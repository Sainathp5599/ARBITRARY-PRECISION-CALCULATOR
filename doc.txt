PROJECT TITLE : ARBITRARY PRECISION CALCULATOR

NAME          : PATIL SAINATH MUKUNDRAO

DATE          : 24 / 11 / 2025

DESCRIPTION   : This project implements arithmetic operations on very large integers 
                using a doubly linked list (Dlist) in C. 
                Each digit of a number is stored in a node, allowing operations on numbers 
                far beyond the limits of standard data types. 
                The project supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division 
                (using manual long-division by repeated subtraction),along with sign handling, 
                magnitude comparison, and formatted vertical display of operations.

SAMPLE I/O    :

                Example 1: Addition
                Input : 9999 + 1
                Output:
                9999
                +   1
                -----
                10000

                Example 2: Subtraction
                Input : 5000 - 4999
                Output:
                5000
                -4999
                -----
                    1

                Example 3: Multiplication
                Input : 123 x 45
                Output:
                123
                x  45
                -----
                5535

                Example 4: Division
                Input : 15789 / 57
                Output:
                Quotient  = 277
                Remainder = 0
                (Method uses repeated subtraction like manual long division.)

CONCEPT USED  :
                • Doubly linked list to store digits.
                • Dynamic memory allocation (malloc/free).
                • String parsing and input validation.
                • Digit-wise addition with carry.
                • Digit-wise subtraction with borrow.
                • Grade-school multiplication method.
                • Long-division method (bring-down + repeated subtraction).
                • Magnitude comparison algorithms.
                • Handling of + / - signs.
                • Leading zero removal.
                • Formatted vertical display of arithmetic operations.
